    % Transform the single-integrator to unicycle dynamics using the the
    % transformation we created earlier

    dxu = uni_barrier_cert_boundary(dxu, x);
    
    %% Send velocities to agents
    
    % Set velocities of agents 1,...,N

    % Send the previously set velocities to the agents.  This function must be called!
