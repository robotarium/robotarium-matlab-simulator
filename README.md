# NEW VERSION

The simulator has been updated to work with the brand new GRITSBot X!  Gains accross the utilities have changes.  **Please check out the examples to update your own code.**

# MATLAB Version 

Currently, we know that the simulator works with MATLAB 2014b and higher.  The backwards compatibility issues are mostly due to changes in the way MATLAB handles figures in newer releases.

# Required Toolboxes 

We make heavy use of MATLAB's optimization toolbox function 'quadprog.'  Though this toolbox isn't necessarily required, all of our barrier function algorithms utilize this function.

# robotarium-matlab-simulator
MATLAB simulator for the Robotarium!  The purpose of the Robotarium simulator is to ensure that algorithms perform reasonably well before deployment onto the Robotarium.  Note that scripts created for the simulator can be directly deployed onto the Robotarium.  To ensure minimum modification after deployment, the simulator has been created to closely approximate the actual behavior of the Robotarium's agents. 

# Usage 

First, take a look at the "examples" folder for a few, simple examples.  Note that, to run these examples, you must first run the "init.m" script to add the requisite directories.
